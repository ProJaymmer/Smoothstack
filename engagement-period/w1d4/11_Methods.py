# Create a simple list
lst = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

# The count() method will count the number of occurrences of an element in a list.
# Check how many times 2 shows up in the list
print(lst.count(2))

# In general Python you can use the help() function to get more help about the method.
# print(help(lst.count))
