# Assignment

In yesterday's assigment you can add login/logout pages which will keep track of a session.

Your website already should have the main page (main.html), about page (about.html), 
and contactus (contactus.html), however until you are logged in, the contactus
page will not be visible.

## Details

Please demonstrate the use of following features we taught in class today:

- cookies and sessions
- contactus messages get appended and can be seen as a list on main.html
