# Assignment

In yesterday's assigment you added login/logout pages which kept track of a session.
You also added cookies/sessions. 

Your website already should have the main page (main.html), about page (about.html), 
and contactus (contactus.html), however until you are logged in, the contactus
page was not visible.

## Details

- show how you can save contactus messages in sqlite
- show how you can use alchemy to save contactus messages in sqlite
- show how you can use wtforms to save contactus messages in sqlite
